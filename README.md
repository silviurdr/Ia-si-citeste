# Ia Și Citește! :books:


 Ia Și Citește is the first project from my portfolio, built at the beginning of 2019, using the coding knowledge I've aquired from books and online resources.

 ## Motivation

Since reading is my favourite hobby, it was easy to chose the subject for my first project. Reading helped me evolved in many ways and I like to promote this activity whenever I have the opportunity.

## How I built this website

I have considered that it's important to use pure HTML and CSS, in order to consolidate my knowledges. This way I was able to establish a very good foundation for these 2 important skills for a front-end developer. In my latest project, I've started using Bootstrap too and it made me realize how important was to build Ia Și Citește from scratch. 

This was also my introduction to JavaScript and I've decided to add JavaScript code to each of the pages from my website. 

Technologies used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Photoshop

## The design of Ia Și Citește

Besides the pages format, I wanted to add to the design of the site some header images edited in Photoshop. 

I didn't have a strict plan for the subject of the pages, whenever I got a new idea, I've just added the page to my website. Adding a new page was among my favorite moments, because I knew that I had to create another header image, relevant for the respective page.

The format of the contact page was an idea that I liked a lot.


## Several of website features

* Full screen image slider
* Google Maps JavaScript API with book-friendly places from Brasov
* Contact form
* Hidden random book recommendation in the site header
* Tip on the home page, adapted to the moment of the day

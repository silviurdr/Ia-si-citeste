 Ia Și Citește is the first project from my portfolio, built at beginning of 2019, using my coding knowledge aquired from books and online resources.

 ## Motivation

Since reading is my favourite hobby, it was easy to chose the subject for my first project. Reading helped me evolved in many ways and I like to promote this activity whenever I have an opportunity.

## How I built this website

I have considered that it's important to use pure HTML and CSS, in order to consolidate my knowledges. This way I was able to establish a very good foundation for these 2 important skills for a front-end developer. In my latest projected, I've started using Bootstrap too and it made me realize how importan was to built Ia Și Citește from scratch. 

This was also my introduction to JavaScript and I've decided to add JavaScript code to each of the pages from my website. 

Technologies used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Photoshop
